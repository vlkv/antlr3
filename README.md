antlr3
======

It's an unpacked sources from antlr-3.3.tar.gz taken from https://github.com/antlr/website-antlr3/tree/gh-pages/download

The reason, why I didn't just clone https://github.com/antlr/antlr3 is because history ends at the point of svn->git migration and 3.3 version seems to be earlier.

Why do I need antlr 3.3 if the latest version is 3.5? Because I use antlr with options "language=JavaScript;" and by some reason  it's broken in the latest antlr3 version.
